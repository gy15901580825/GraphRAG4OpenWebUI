The edge interface is an interface where a Customer network is connected to the Provider Edge switch. The network which the switch belongs to is a Provider network. These networks (Customer ones and Provider one) can use the same VLAN-IDs and the edge interface must perform vlan mapping between Customer VLANs (C-VLANs) and Provider VLANs (S-VLANs).\n\nOn an edge interface C-VLANs are mapped to S-VLANs and the original C-VLAN tags are kept as part of payload. When a frame is sent on non-edge tagged interface, it is encapsulated with another layer of S-VLAN tag to which the original C-VLAN-ID is mapped. Therefore, transmitted on non-edge interfaces frames are double-tagged, with the outer S-VLAN tag and inner C-VLAN tag. When a frame is sent on an edge interface the S-VLAN tag is stripped.\n\nOn an edge interface C-VLANs are mapped to the S-VLANs and the original C-VLAN-ID in input frame is replaced by the S-VLAN ID to which it is mapped. Untagged frames are dropped.

All the limitations for edge ports specified above are checked by the switchport vlan-mapping commands and by the commands configuring these features.\n\nBy default the switch does not forward frames received on edge ports with the following destination MAC addresses:\n\n01:80:C2:00:00:00-01:80:C2:00:00:FF\n\n01:00:0C:00:00:00-01:00:0C:FF:FF:FF\n\n01:00:0C:CD:CD:D0\n\nNote.
