Use the no form of this command to delete the VLAN(s).\n\nSyntax\nvlan vlan-range | {vlan-id [name vlan-name]} [media ethernet] [state active]\n\nno vlan vlan-range\n\nParameters\nvlan-range—Specifies a list of VLAN IDs. Separate nonconsecutive VLAN IDs with a comma and no spaces. Use a hyphen to designate a range of IDs (range: 2-4094).\n\nvlan-id—Specifies a VLAN ID. (range: 2-4094).\n\nvlan-name—Specifies the VLAN name. (range: 1–32 characters).\n\nmedia—Specifies the media type of the VLAN. Valid values are ethernet.\n\nstate—Specifies whether the state of the VLAN.
