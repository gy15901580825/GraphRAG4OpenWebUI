{"result": "There are no named entities that match the specified entity types (organization, person, geo, event) in the provided text. Therefore, there are no claims to extract.\n\nOutput: \n<|COMPLETE|>", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

Use the switchport general allowed vlan Interface Configuration mode command to add/remove VLANs to/from a general port and configure whether packets on the egress are tagged or untagged.

Separate nonconsecutive VLAN IDs with a comma and no spaces. Use a hyphen to designate a range of IDs. (range: 1–4094)\n\nremove vlan-list—List of VLAN IDs to remove. Separate nonconsecutive VLAN IDs with a comma and no spaces. Use a hyphen to designate a range of IDs.\n\ntagged—Specify that packets are transmitted tagged for the configured VLANs\n\nuntagged—Specify that packets are transmitted untagged for the configured VLANs (this is the default)\n\nDefault Configuration\nThe port is not a member of any VLAN.\n\nCommand Mode\nInterface (Ethernet, Port Channel) Configuration mode\n\nUser Guidelines\nIf the interface is a forbidden member of an added VLAN, the interface does not become a member of this specific VLAN. There will be an error message in this case (\"An interface cannot become a a member of a forbidden VLAN. This message will only be displayed once.\") and the command continues to execute in case if there are more VLANs in the vlan-list.\n\nA non-existed VLAN cannot be configured. When a VLAN is removed it is deleted from the vlan-list.\n\nThe configuration is applied only when the port mode is general.\n\nExample\nThe example adds gi1/0/1 and to VLAN 2 and 3.
