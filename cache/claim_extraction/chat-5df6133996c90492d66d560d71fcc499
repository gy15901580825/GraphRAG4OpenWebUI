{"result": "There are no named entities that match the specified entity types (organization, person, geo, event) in the provided text. Therefore, there are no claims to extract.\n\n<|COMPLETE|>", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

If the port is assigned to none, it is removed from the previous VLAN and not assigned to any other VLAN.\n\nExample\nThe following example assigns access port gi1/0/1 to VLAN 2 (and removes it from its previous VLAN).\n\nswitchxxxxxx(config)# interface gi1/0/2\nswitchxxxxxx(config-if)# switchport mode access\nswitchxxxxxx(config-if)# switchport access vlan 2\nswitchport trunk allowed vlan\nA trunk interface is an untagged member of a single VLAN, and, in addition, it may be an tagged member of one or more VLANs. Use the switchport trunk allowed vlan Interface Configuration mode command to add/remove VLAN(s) to/from a trunk port. Use the no form of the command to return to the default.\n\nSyntax\nswitchport trunk allowed vlan {all | none | vlan-list | add vlan-list | remove vlan-list | except vlan-list}\n\nno switchport trunk allowed vlan\n\nParameters\nall—Specifies all VLANs from 1 to 4094. At any time, the port belongs to all VLANs existing at the time. (range: 1–4094).\n\nnone—Specifies an empty VLAN list The port does not belong to any VLAN.\n\nvlan-list— Specifies the list of VLAN IDs the interface is member of. The VLAN(s) specified in this command are the only VLAN(s) the port will be member of (all previous settings related to trunk VLAN membership are discarded). Use a hyphen to designate a range of IDs. Separate nonconsecutive VLAN IDs with a comma and no spaces (range: 1-4094).\n\nadd vlan-list—List of VLAN IDs to add to the port. Separate nonconsecutive VLAN IDs with a comma and no spaces. Use a hyphen to designate a range of IDs.\n\nremove vlan-list—List of VLAN IDs to remove from a port. Separate nonconsecutive VLAN IDs with a comma and no spaces. Use a hyphen to designate a range of IDs.\n\nexcept vlan-list—List of VLAN IDs including all VLANs from range 1-4094 except VLANs belonging to vlan-list.\n\nDefault Configuration\nBy default, trunk ports belongs to all created VLANs.\n\nCommand Mode\nInterface (Ethernet, Port Channel) Configuration mode\n\nUser Guidelines\nUse the switchport trunk allowed vlan command to specify which VLANs the port belongs to when its mode is configured as trunk.\n\nNon-existed VLANs can be configured. When a non-existed VLAN is created the port will add to it automatically.\n\nForbidden VLANs can be configured.\n\nExample\nTo add VLANs 2,3 and 100 to trunk ports 1 to 13\n\nswitchxxxxxx(config)# interface range gi1/0/1-3\nswitchxxxxxx(config-if)# switchport mode trunk\nswitchxxxxxx(config-if)# switchport trunk allowed vlan add 2-3,100\nswitchxxxxxx(config-if)\nswitchport trunk native vlan\nIf an untagged packet arrives on a trunk port, it is directed to the port’s native VLAN. Use the switchport trunk native vlan Interface Configuration mode command to define the native VLAN for a trunk interface. Use the no form of this command to restore the default native VLAN.\n\nSyntax\nswitchport trunk native vlan {vlan-id | none}\n\nno switchport trunk native vlan\n\nParameters\nvlan-id—Specifies the native VLAN ID.\n\nnone—Specifies the access port cannot belong to any VLAN.\n\nDefault Configuration\nThe default native VLAN is the Default VLAN.\n\nCommand Mode\nInterface (Ethernet, Port Channel) Configuration mode\n\nUser Guidelines\nA value of the interface PVID is set to this VLAN ID.When the interface belongs to the Native VLAN it is set as VLAN untagged egress interface.\n\nThe configuration is applied only when the port mode is trunk.\n\nExamples\nThe following example defines VLAN 2 as native VLAN for port gi1/0/1:\n\nswitchxxxxxx(config)# interface gi1/0/1\nswitchxxxxxx(config-if)# switchport trunk native vlan 2\nswitchxxxxxx(config-if)# exit\nswitchport general allowed vlan\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
