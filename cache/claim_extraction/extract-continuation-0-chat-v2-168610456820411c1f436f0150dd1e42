Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

This mode is used to create VLAN(s) and define the default VLAN.\n\nUse the exit command to return to Global Configuration mode.\n\nSyntax\nvlan database\n\nDefault Configuration\nVLAN 1 exists by default.\n\nCommand Mode\nGlobal Configuration mode\n\nExample\nThe following example enters the VLAN Configuration mode, creates VLAN 1972 and exits VLAN Configuration mode.\n\nswitchxxxxxx(config)# vlan database\nswitchxxxxxx(config-vlan)# vlan 1972\nswitchxxxxxx(config-vlan)# exit\nvlan\nUse the vlan VLAN Configuration mode or Global Configuration mode command to create a VLAN and assign it a name (if only a single VLAN is being created). Use the no form of this command to delete the VLAN(s).\n\nSyntax\nvlan vlan-range | {vlan-id [name vlan-name]} [media ethernet] [state active]\n\nno vlan vlan-range\n\nParameters\nvlan-range—Specifies a list of VLAN IDs. Separate nonconsecutive VLAN IDs with a comma and no spaces. Use a hyphen to designate a range of IDs (range: 2-4094).\n\nvlan-id—Specifies a VLAN ID. (range: 2-4094).\n\nvlan-name—Specifies the VLAN name. (range: 1–32 characters).\n\nmedia—Specifies the media type of the VLAN. Valid values are ethernet.\n\nstate—Specifies whether the state of the VLAN. Valid values are active.\n\nDefault Configuration\nVLAN 1 exists by default.\n\nCommand Mode\nGlobal Configuration mode\n\nVLAN Database Configuration mode\n\nUser Guidelines\nIf the VLAN does not exist, it is created. If the VLAN cannot be created then the command is finished with error and the current context is not changed.\n\nExample\nThe following example creates a few VLANs.

If the command returns an error on one of the VLANs, an error message is displayed, and the system attempts to configure the remaining VLANs.\n\nExample\nThe following example groups VLANs 221 through 228 and 889 to receive the same command(s).\n\nswitchxxxxxx(config)# interface range vlan 221-228, vlan 889\nname\nUse the name Interface Configuration (VLAN) mode command to name a VLAN.
