Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

Use the no form of this command to restore the default configuration.\n\nSyntax\nswitchport general forbidden vlan {add vlan-list | remove vlan-list}\n\nno switchport general forbidden vlan\n\nParameters\nadd vlan-list—Specifies a list of VLAN IDs to add to interface. Separate nonconsecutive VLAN IDs with a comma and no spaces. Use a hyphen to designate a range of IDs.\n\nremove vlan-list—Specifies a list of VLAN IDs to remove from interface. Separate nonconsecutive VLAN IDs with a comma and no spaces. Use a hyphen designate a range of IDs.\n\nDefault Configuration\nAll VLANs are allowed.\n\nCommand Mode\nInterface (Ethernet, Port Channel) Configuration mode\n\nUser Guidelines\nThe forbidden VLAN cannot be one that does not exist on the system, or one that is already defined on the port.\n\nExample\nThe following example define s gi1/0/4 as a forbidden membership in VLANs 5-7:\n\nswitchxxxxxx(config)# interface gi1/0/4\nswitchxxxxxx(config-if)# switchport general forbidden vlan add 5-7\nswitchxxxxxx(config-if)# exit\nswitchport customer vlan\nUse the switchport customer vlan Interface Configuration mode command to set the port's VLAN when the interface is in customer mode (set by the switchport mode command). Use the no form of this command to restore the default configuration.\n\nSyntax\nswitchport customer vlan vlan-id\n\nno switchport customer vlan\n\nParameters\nvlan-id—Specifies the customer VLAN.\n\nDefault Configuration\nNo VLAN is configured as customer.\n\nCommand Mode\nInterface (Ethernet, Port Channel) Configuration mode\n\nUser Guidelines\nWhen a port is in customer mode it is in QinQ mode. This enables the user to use their own VLAN arrangements (PVID) across a provider network. The switch is in QinQ mode when it has one or more customer ports.\n\nExample\nThe following example defines gi1/0/4 as a member of customer VLAN 5.\n\nswitchxxxxxx(config)# interface gi1/0/4\nswitchxxxxxx(config-if)# switchport mode customer\nswitchxxxxxx(config-if)# switchport customer vlan 5\nshow interfaces switchport\nUse the show interfaces switchport Privileged EXEC command to display the administrative and operational status of all interfaces or a specific interface.\n\nSyntax\nshow interfaces switchport [interface-id]\n\nParameters\nInterface-id—Specifies an interface ID. The interface ID can be one of the following types: Ethernet port or port-channel.\n\nCommand Mode\nPrivileged EXEC mode\n\nDefault\nDisplays the status of all interfaces.\n\nUser Guidelines\nEach port mode has its own private configuration. The show interfaces switchport command displays all these configurations, but only the port mode configuration that corresponds to the current port mode displayed in \"Administrative Mode\" is active.\n\nExample\nswitchxxxxxx# show interfaces switchport gi1/0/1\nGathering information...\nS-VLAN Ethernet Type: 0x88a8 (802.1ad)\nVLAN Mapping Tunnel L2 protocols Global CoS: 6\nName: gi1/0/1\nSwitchport: enable\nAdministrative Mode: access\nOperational Mode: down\nAccess Mode VLAN: 1\nAccess Multicast TV VLAN: none\nTrunking Native Mode VLAN: 1\nTrunking VLANs: 1\n                2-4094 (Inactive)\nGeneral PVID: 1\nGeneral VLANs: none\nGeneral Egress Tagged VLANs: none\nGeneral Forbidden VLANs: none\nGeneral Ingress Filtering: enabled\nGeneral Acceptable Frame Type: all\nGeneral GVRP status: Enabled\nGeneral GVRP VLANs: none\nCustomer Mode VLAN: none\nVLAN Mapping Tunnel:\nS-VLAN Ethernet Type: 0x8100 (802.1q)\nC-VLANs                 Outer S-VLAN\n--------------------    ------------\n2                       12\n12,16-18                100\ndefault                 1100\nVLAN Mapping Tunnel L2 protocols S-VLAN: 100\nVLAN Mapping Tunnel L2 protocols Interface CoS: 6 (global)\nVLAN Mapping Tunnel L2 protocols forward enabled: cdp,stp\nDrop Threshold: 4 kbps (default)\nVLAN Mapping One-to-one:\nC-VLANs                 Translated S-VLAN\n--------------------    ----------------------\n2                       102\n12                      112\n100                     10\nPrivate-vlan promiscuous-association primary VLAN: none\nPrivate-vlan promiscuous-association Secondary VLANs: none\nPrivate-vlan host-association primary VLAN: none\nPrivate-vlan host-association Secondary VLAN: none\nProtected: Enabled, Uplink is gi1/0/1\nClassification rules:\nClassification Type   Group ID   VLAN ID\n-------------------   --------   -------\nProtocol                   1        19\nProtocol                   1        20\nProtocol                   2        72\nSubnet                     1        15\nMAC                        1        77\nvlan prohibit-internal-usage\nUse the vlan prohibit-internal-usage command in Global configuration mode to specify VLANs that cannot be used by the switch as internal VLANs.\n\nSyntax\nvlan prohibit-internal-usage none | {add | except | remove} vlan-list\n\nParameters\nnone—The Prohibit Internal Usage VLAN\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
