-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, first identify all entities needed from the text in order to capture the information and ideas in the text.
Next, report all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in The primary language of the provided text is "English." as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. If you have to translate into The primary language of the provided text is "English.", just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.

 Guidelines
Use the no switchport command to set the interface as a Layer 3 interface.

An interface cannot be set as a Layer 3 interface if 802x.1 is enabled on the interface and one of the following conditions is true:

The host mode differs from multi-host.

MAC-Based or WEB-Based authentication is enabled.

Radius VLAN assignment is enabled.

Examples
Example 1 - The following example puts the port gi1/0/1 into Layer 2 mode.

switchxxxxxx(config)# interface gi1/0/1
switchxxxxxx(config-if)# switchport
Example 2 - The following example puts the port gi1/0/1 into Layer 3 mode.

switchxxxxxx(config)# interface gi1/0/1
switchxxxxxx(config-if)# no switchport
switchport mode
Use the switchport mode Interface Configuration mode command to configure the VLAN membership mode. Use the no form of this command to restore the default configuration.

Interface (Ethernet, Port Channel) Configuration mode

Example
The following example configures port gi1/0/3 to be in general mode and to discard untagged frames at ingress.

switchxxxxxx(config)# interface gi1/0/3
switchxxxxxx(config-if)# switchport mode general
switchxxxxxx(config-if)# switchport general acceptable-frame-type tagged-only
switchport general forbidden vlan
Use the switchport general forbidden vlan Interface Configuration mode command to forbid adding/removing specific VLANs to/from a port. Use the no form of this command to restore the default configuration.

Syntax
switchport general forbidden vlan {add vlan-list | remove vlan-list}

no switchport general forbidden vlan

Parameters
add vlan-list—Specifies a list of VLAN IDs to add to interface. Separate nonconsecutive VLAN IDs with a comma and no spaces. Use a hyphen to designate a range of IDs.

remove vlan-list—Specifies a list of VLAN IDs to remove from interface.
